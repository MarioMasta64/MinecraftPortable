# MinecraftPortable

Known Issues: unknown?

Ive made many changes to the project it now has

    New Profile Creation
    Launching Existing Profiles
    A Main Default Directory For Imported Minecraft
    Deleting Profiles
    Updating The Program Easily
    Ability To Use Portable Or System Java (Portable Java Is Downloaded If Its Not Installed)
    And A Basic License

@Dr.Hacknik gave me some ideas

Hint: theres a special version of this that may be seen in the future. but for now it shall remain a MYSTERY~
all you need to download is launcher.bat
